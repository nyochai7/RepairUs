	ideas for bed bed:
		things that if they are not done each will have to do before going to bed?
		maybe her dishes (and be sad)
		and him laundry (and be sad)
		maybe both have to shower if they didn't already (and be sad that it's late)
		maybe also eat (and be sad)
		or you just can't take the eating and the showering out of the thing
	
	ideas for things that make them sad:
		1. he - has to do the dishes ("I always clean her messes!")
		2. she - has to do the laundry ("I always have to do this!")
		3. she - goes to the toilet and the sit is up ("He always leave it like this!")
		4. he - sees dirty dishes ("She always makes a mess")
		5. both - go to the shower and it is taken
		6. both - go to the toilet and it is taken
		7. both - eating bad food
		8. both - go to bed and it's not made
	
	ideas for things that make them happy:
		1. both - they eat together
		2. he - sees the dishes clean after she cleaned them
		3. she - sees the laundry done after he did it (we need to give her a reason to go there)
		4. both - eating good food 
		5. both - being complimented
		6. him - reading a book?
		7. her - watching tv?
